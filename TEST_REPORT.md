## Running Tests

To run all tests:
```
go test ./...
```

To run tests for a specific package:
```
go test ./internal/scanner
go test ./internal/reporter
go test ./internal/git
go test ./pkg/utils
go test ./pkg/spinner
go test ./cmd
```

To run tests with verbose output:
```
go test -v ./...
```

## Test Implementation Notes

All tests are designed to work independently without external dependencies. Tests that would normally require external services (like Git repositories) are properly mocked or skipped when running in automated test environments.

The test suite focuses on unit testing individual components with clear separation of concerns. Integration points between components are tested through well-defined interfaces.

## Test Coverage Goals

The implemented tests aim to achieve:
- High code coverage for core detection and reporting logic
- Comprehensive testing of edge cases and error handling
- Validation of user-facing functionality and output formats
- Verification of security pattern detection accuracy
